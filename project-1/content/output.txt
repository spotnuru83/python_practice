Moderator:  Ladies and gentlemen, good day, and welcome to the Titan Company Limited Q3 FY '24 
Earnings Conference Call. As a reminder, all participant lines will be in the listen -only mode 
and there will be an opportunity for you to ask questions after the presentation concludes. Should 
you need assistance during the call, please signal an operator by pressing star then zer o on your 
touchtone phone.  Please note that this conference is being recorded.  
 I now hand the conference over to Mr. C.K. Venkataraman, Managing Director, Titan Company 
Limited. Thank you, and over to you, Mr. Venkataraman.  
C K Venkataraman:  Thank you very much. Hello, and welcome to everyone on the call. Quarter 3 was a very good 
quarter in terms of sales growth for the company, standalone as well as consolidated, including 
CaratLane and TEAL  subsidiaries. This growth was driven substantially by the Jewellery 
business and the Watches business, while EyeCare, ethnic wear and the perfume categories were 
under pressure in terms of sales growth.  
 But our overall understanding of all the categories and various strategies that are already in place 
gives us a lot of confidence for Quarter 4 and FY '25. And the overall confidence level in the 
company is very high  and we continue to be bullish on the prospects for all the businesses. And 
the rest of the information is on the presentation, which you have access to.  
 Now we can move directly into the questions, please.  
Moderator:  Thank you very much.  The first question is from the line of Devanshu Bansal  from Emkay 
Global.  Please go ahead.  
Devanshu Bansal:  Sir, retail UCP growth as well as like -to-like growth has seen a meaningful deceleration 
compared to previous two quarters. So what are the reasons attributable for this? Do you expect 
growth to bounce back in the coming quarters? This is for Tanishq.  
Ajoy Chawla:  This is Ajoy here. I had mentioned in a previous quarterly call that there was a certain timing 
effect of Shradh between Quarter 2 and Quarter 3. Last year, it was in Quarter 2 in September. 
This year, it was in Quarter 3 in October. So consequently, that time, we were not able to estimate 
exactly what is likely to be this interplay. So yes, to that extent, there is an impact.  
 And the second piece is, so we had a very good festive season growth, in fact, very happy with 
that. But then thereafter in December, there seems to be have been a blip, perhaps driven by a 
sudden spurt in gold prices, which happened. Between November to D ecem ber, gold prices went 
up by INR  200 a gram. And over previous December, it was INR  800 a gram.  
 So sometimes when that happens, there is some hesitancy from customers to come into the 
market. And therefore, what we looked at is we looked at data from September to November 
and compared. And there, the growth continued to be very healthy because that covers Shradh 
in bo th the years. And then December was a particular month. And then again, Jan has been 
good.    Titan Company Limited

Sensitivity: Internal   So in many ways, I would consider December as the blip and the Shradh period which is 
resulting in the sales figures looking lower than the previous quarters. My confidence is that in 
Quarter 4, we will bounce back. How much more it will bounce back? I can't say. But one is 
hoping and expecting it to be better than Quarter 3.  
Devanshu Bansal:  Got it, sir. Second question is on the margin front. The Jewellery EBIT margin has declined 
about 80 basis points this quarter. In my opinion, a 2% mix change towards studded should have 
resulted into only half of this decline plus there should have been s ome operating leverage as 
well. So what are the other growth investments that we are doing which is leading to this kind 
of a margin decline?  
Ajoy Chawla:  So I'm not very sure about the math behind what you said. But the reasons for margin decline 
are as follows. One is, as you pointed out, studded ratio as studded mix being lower, that is 
certainly one of the reasons. The second thing is that there has been  -- and I mean, the 
competitive intensity goes up whenever gold prices rise significantly. So even in Quarter 3, we 
have seen gold prices go up 16% year -on-year. And that's the season where everybody is waiting 
to sell.  
 So naturally, market competitive intensity goes up. And therefore, we've also responded 
tactically with offers, with exchange, with the program to protect gold rate for customers, like 
we've done earlier on as well. Because for us, ensuring that during the  most important season, 
we don't lose share. That's the priority. So some amount of payout sits there. And of course, 
marketing, we have also invested during this quarter.  
 Because there is growing competitive intensity, so we felt it's the right time to put in. So we 
continued our advertising for weddings. We continued besides the festive season. And we also 
did some  work on digital on studded, et cetera. So marketing costs also went up over last year to 
some extent. So these are all the top 3 investments that I can think of. I don't know if your math 
adds up in your mind. But this is -- these are the three things.  
Devanshu Bansal:  Yes. So I was thinking that 20% -- yes, sure.  
Ashok Sonthalia:  Just to add, if you look at quarter -on-quarter, there could be several case s. But 9 months, if you 
look at, it is reasonably okay on the way we have been talking about. So yes, just to add that.  
Moderator:  Thank you very much.  The next question is from Latika Chopra  from JPMorgan.  Please go 
ahead.  
Latika Chopra:  My first question was if you could share your store opening plans for key Jewellery formats: 
Tanishq, CaratLane and Mia. And I noticed in this fiscal year, YTD, you've opened 43 Tanishq 
stores and 50 Mia stores but only 40 CaratLane stores. And the like -to-like retail sales growth 
for CaratLane has also been lagging Tanishq. So is this a price or a mix issue? Or is there some 
bit of a demand issue that you could elaborate on?  Thank you.  
Ajoy Chawla:  So I'll just clarify, Latika, we have, in domestic, opened 36 Tanishq stores. The remaining, I 
think, will be to do with international. And in Mia, we have 50; CaratLane, 40. Those figures 
are right. In Tanishq, we saw the opportunity to up the play. And e ven though we had not planned   Titan Company Limited
  February  01, 202 4  
Page 4 of 20 
 
Sensitivity: Internal  so many, we went ahead and expanded because we found the right opportunity, right property, 
and we were able to get those going before Dhan teras. 
 And we have now, in a way, expanded the list of towns and markets and said whenever the 
opportunity presents itself, we will go ahead and open because execution can follow thereafter. 
In the case of CaratLane, while 40 have been opened, there were, I think , 90 opened last year. 
So many of those 90 had to stabilize as well. And there are many more which will come into 
play as we go forward. So this is not indicative of any long -term strategy. This has something to 
do within this year, that's all.  
C K Venkataraman:  Plus one thing to keep in mind, Latika, is this is not the equivalent of an expensive car versus a 
more affordable car, which can go to smaller towns faster than an expensive car. Tanishq is a 
more traditional jewellery  brand, which is available in a Rivaah, in Sagar, in places like that, 
where generally people buy jewellery . Whereas at CaratLane, it will take longer time to reach a 
Rivaah or a Sagar. So that's advantage that Tanishq has. So that also has a bearing in this plus 
what Ajoy s aid about 90 plus 40 here.  
Ajoy Chawla:  So if I may carry on, Mia and CaratLane actually will continue to see more opportunities also. 
It's just a timing piece. I mean, last year, 90 and, therefore, this year, whether 40 will become 
50, 70, 80, 90, that depends on the opportunities. And therefor e, you must see it over a 2 -year 
time frame rather than a single year.  
Latika Chopra:  Sure. That helps. The second bit I wanted to ask was your other two segments. On Watches, how 
-- you talked about higher marketing expense impacting margins. But on a full year basis or over 
medium term, how should we think about the margin profile, given the salience of Wearables 
will keep rising?  
 And on eyewear separately, numbers on like -to-like growth rates have been muted. And it seems 
store addition has slowdown this fiscal year. So are there any aspects you intend to revisit here 
to drive better growth momentum in this segment? Thank you.  
Suparna Mitra:  So for Watches, yes, in the festive season, we spent a lot of money marketing our brands and all 
our festive collection. So that is kind of way higher than what we had spent last year. And it did 
help us in getting a very good sales top line growth. The overall margin, which we had earlier 
indicated maybe 13 right now, 11 to 12, at least for the next couple of quarters.  
Because of the overall mix, as you mentioned, Wearables, where the AGC (adjusted gross 
contribution) is slightly lower, becoming a big propeller of growth. And so therefore, it is -- at 
this point, this is -- it will kind of see this kind of margin for the next two / couple of quarters.  
Saumen Bhaumik:  Latika, this is Saumen from EyeCare. Beginning of the year, I think we have said that our 
expansion will be calibrated. So it is not a rapid expansion. That said, in the year, I think we're 
almost over 60 -plus stores. But we also had to rationalize a few stores, which are not sort of 
delivering the expected kind of numbers. So net count has not significantly changed. But 
expansion and rationalization both happen ed simultaneously.    Titan Company Limited

Sensitivity: Internal   As far as the growth is concerned, from mid -September to November across the industry, there 
has been, one would say, a very strong headwind that everybody experienced. We have not been 
an exception. There is no exception really in the whole thing. And so  it was very difficult to sort 
of get the numbers going. And December was better.  And that's what we expect the coming 
months to be. So what we saw here is kind of a reflection of industry -level phenomena rather 
than just a specific to our Division.  
Moderator:  The next question is from Avi Mehta from Macquarie.  
Avi Mehta:  Sir, I just wanted to check if you could update on how the demand in the Jewellery for the sub -
INR 50,000 segment is behaving  because you had pointed towards that being under -stressed. 
Has that changed? Or is it still deteriorating further? Any updates on that, please?  
Ajoy Chawla:  Yes. So the sub -- I would broaden it to sub -INR 100,000 because it's difficult because the gold 
price is going up and overall, some shifts take place between slabs. So sub -INR 100,000 at an 
overall level, if I look at it from a portfolio play of Tanishq, CaratLane, Mia, I think there is a 
stability in buyer growth that I'm seeing. And I'm now looking at the period that I mentioned in 
the earlier part of this call, September to N ovember, then I look at December, then I look at Jan 
also. And I'm  seeing a very stable set of buyer growth. So across the portfolio, it's there. But 
having said that, if I think of same -store growth for even CaratLane, Tanishq or some of the Mia 
stores, I mean, Tanishq in the sub - INR 100,000, there seems to be some amount of sluggishness 
in the new customer segment out there. And that is -- there's a softness, let's put it that way. Now 
is it because -- partly, it's because we think that consumer is facing some economic challenges.  
 Because of they could be modern consumers, they are IT, digital and that -- there have been 
some economic challenges for that consumer segment. And the second piece is there could be 
some share of wallet, let's say, shifts are not structural, I would say,  fluctuations that are taking 
place. Because we see certain categories of it grew well, some others were still depressed.  Now 
some categories have started picking up, whether it is travel, hospitality, experiences, vacations, 
SUVs, but garments is down. So there is something going on in the share of wallet in the context 
of some economic truths for this segment. And therefore , the sub -INR 100,000 and also included 
in that, the sub -INR 50,000, does have some degree of softness relative to what we think it 
should be.  
 Having said that, when I look at it as a portfolio play across all the brands that we have in our 
portfolio, I'm seeing a fairly good stability on buyer growth at a total level. Same -store growth, 
yes, but then we've also added lots of stores in CaratLane , Mia across the board, so not able to 
get a sense on that. But yes, there is some -- we wish it could be better. And it has remained 
stable and similar. It hasn't really deteriorated nor has it significantly improved or changed.  
Avi Mehta:  Got it, sir. And sir, the second bit is on this competitive intensity that you alluded or highlighted. 
Given the increase in gold price, does this in any way make us revisit our margin expectation 
for the year? Or are we -- is this in a fairly comfortable level?    Titan Company Limited
  February  01, 202 4  
Page 6 of 20 
 
Sensitivity: Internal   Because you've been citing this, however, the margin delivery has not taken a hit. But I just 
wanted to get a sense if that has changed, especially because some of the other peers are going 
a lot aggressive on store additions, so would love to hear your comments on that part.  
Ajoy Chawla:  So our EBIT margins continue to be in the range that was indicated between 12% to 13%, despite 
this weak studded quarter and weaker than what, let's say, we had last year. So at 12.2%, it is 
fairly good, I would say. It's not such a -- and as Ashok pointed  out, when he alluded to it, when 
you look at it at a YTD level, because of the shifts between things here and there, it is also pretty 
good. It is exactly bang on in that range of 12.4%.  
 So to me and to Ashok and all of us, we've been saying 12% to 13% is a very good range to 
expect our margins to be, competitive pressures notwithstanding. They will come and go. There 
will be seasons when  everybody wants to do something. But we will respond. And there are 
ways to manage the margin, both gross margin as well as net margin. So we are still confident 
of the 12% to 13% range.  
Avi Mehta:  And sir, on the competitive intensity, has that changed? Because some peer has been accelerating 
on store additions. I say this competitive intensity does not necessarily mean pricing. It also is 
in terms of being able to add franchisees or otherwise?  
Ajoy Chawla:  No, that is not such a big worry for us. Because actually, we track 45 to 50 competitors. We 
don't track one or two national chains. And for us in every market, the local players are as much 
an important competitor as much as the national chains. And somet imes local chains are there 
as well as independent stand -alone jewelers will also be there.  
 So we track it at city level. And frankly, one or two players adding 10, 15, 20 more stores or 30 
more stores doesn't move the needle. Because already, there are existing players there. And in 
many of these cities, we are the challenger. So we actually th ink it's good if more players get 
into organized play because that strengthens -- in fact, that brings out the strength of our brand 
even sharper in those markets.  
Avi Mehta:  So market is not a concern, right, sir? That's all I wanted to know, that your salience of market 
share continues to grow up. That's what I wanted to make out.  
Ajoy Chawla:  I think we have gained in many markets, and we have remained stable in most others.  
Moderator:  The next question is from Videesha Sheth from Ambit Capital.  
Videesha Sheth:  I just had one question on the studded mix. What is the reason  for softness seen in the studded 
jewel lery at a stand -alone level? While you mentioned that there was a blip in December for the 
overall jewelry space with a sharp increase in gold prices, but the reason to ask this is that the 
trend is in contrast to the growth that CaratLane has seen. So is it  that the accessible or entry -
level part of the portfolio is relatively unaffected?  
Ajoy Chawla:  No, I think I'll respond in two ways. In the month of December, there was a definite drop in the 
studded sales demand. And as I said, that is 1 month out of if I look at a 4 -5-month period, 
including whatever we have seen in Jan. So we see it as a temporary blip. And also, when we   Titan Company Limited
  February  01, 202 4  
Page 7 of 20 
 
Sensitivity: Internal  spoke to a lot of vendors who supply studded jewellery, they also confirmed that December was 
a very soft month for most players in the category. So that is the second source that I wanted to 
share.  
 Third is if you're asking what has been specifically different, the softness in the sub -INR 100,000 
was one commentary we made anyway. But in this particular quarter, high -value  studded, which 
is INR  5 lakhs and above, etcetera, also saw a certain softness. Now whether it is because of 
share of wallet, because of people deferring their expenses here and there, very difficult to make 
out. But this kind of came through in the month of December particular ly strongly and therefore 
influenced the Quarter 3. As I said, if I look at a 5 -month period, it seems to be temporary and 
not structural.  
Moderator:  The next question is from Siddhant Dand from Goodwill.  
Siddhant Dand:  My first question was on eyewear. Like over the last 5, 6 years, we've been told stories about 
how we can turn around, make changes in the eyewear division. But clearly, we are lagging. 
And can we have a better 3, 5 -year picture? And are we not fooling ourselves, we've not being 
able to make INR100 crores EBIT over there?  
Saumen Bhaumik:  I don't fully understand what you're actually asking from where we were 3 or 4 years back, where 
we are , we ended last year versus where we are. I think it is significantly different than the 
picture that you're referring to. And we had a good Quarter 1, good Quarter 2. We are pretty 
much close to the budget that we have had in the beginning of the year , we had 12% and 16% 
sales growth.  
 As I just explained, between September and November, we saw a kind of resistance in the 
eyewear segment across the industry. There are no player that I've heard nor I spoke to that they 
had a good run. December was a bit of a relief. So, it is a -- there is a cumulative effect of a 
period in which the category did not see too much of a traction. That's what we see. That's what 
we conclude. And we have our plans for future.  
Siddhant Dand:  But over a three -, five -year period now in eyewear, how do you see the industry growing?  
Saumen Bhaumik:  I'm not going to make a projection for the three to five years. Right now, we are looking at the 
next quarter. And as we plan for our FY25, we'll probably share with you  our plans.  
Siddhant Dand:  Okay, okay. And my next question then would be around TEAL. We are doing some good 
business around semiconductors and all over there. But there's not much out for shareholders to 
know. So what's the business that we are doing? What's the market scope over there and our 
customer profile or something like that?  
C K Venkataraman:  Siddhant, you're talking about TEAL?  
Siddhant Dand:  Yes, TEAL. So there are some media articles about our new facility around Hosur and all, but...  
C K Venkataraman:  Yes, our two main businesses in that subsidiary are Manufacturing Services, where we make 
very high -precision components for the aircraft and defence  industry. Our customers are people   Titan Company Limited
  February  01, 202 4  
Page 8 of 20 
 
Sensitivity: Internal  like Collins, Pratt & Whitney engines and all that. And the other division is Automation 
Solutions, where we put together bespoke automation solutions, which use robots, vision 
cameras and welding and stuff like that to automate assembly lines across industries, automotive 
being a big segment which we focus.  
 So these businesses are roughly 50 -50 in terms of share of turnover. Both are international in 
their scope. And the overall opportunity for this company is very, very strong. But because of 
what happened during COVID, particularly in the international aut o -- I mean, aircraft 
manufacturing sector, we had a significant challenge in FY21. But all that is generally behind 
us now. And as we speak, we are on the recovery path and FY25 should be very good.  
Siddhant Dand:  No, so the semiconductor division itself, so it will be within automation?  
Ashok Sonthalia : Manufacturing Services.  
C K Venkataraman:  Manufacturing Services.  
Siddhant Dand:  Manufacturing, okay. And also, within that division, what is the potential...  
Ashok Sonthalia:  Yes. Actually, it's not really a separate division. But manufacturing...  
C K Venkataraman:  This is for the semiconductor machinery industry?  
Siddhant Dand:  Correct, sir.  
C K Venkataraman:  We make sub -assemblies for the semiconductor machinery industry, Manufacturing Services 
arm division, that's, that.  
Siddhant Dand:  Okay. So within that, it's a small division.  
C K Venkataraman:  It's a segment within the Manufacturing Services.  
Siddhant Dand:  Within the Manufacturing, okay.  
Moderator:  The next question is from the line of Nihal Mahesh Jham from Nuvama.  
Nihal Jham:  Sir, my first question was just a clarification that on the Jewellery margin bit, was there any 
impact on diamond prices, which we were discussing earlier, just to be sure about that?  
Ajoy Chawla:  In the current quarter?  
Nihal Jham:  Yes, in the current quarter.  
Ajoy Chawla:  In the current year, no, there is no significant impact o n the diamond margin. There might have 
been something last year, but it was not material enough last year, so I don't know. But in this 
quarter, there is nothing that is extraordinary.  
Nihal Jham:  Yes, more referring from a negative impact rather than a positive one.    Titan Company Limited
  February  01, 202 4  
Page 9 of 20 
 
Sensitivity: Internal   
Ashok Sonthalia:  Small corrections, I think we spoke about on that side.  
Ajoy Chawla:  But it's not very material. No, nothing material, I would say. We took some minor price 
correction on soli taires , but it's a very small quantum, which we felt was appropriate, we took 
but no, nothing material because at an overall level, that has not really impacted too much 
anything, nothing to call out really.  
Nihal Jham:  Sure, just to clarify. The second question was again comparing CaratLane and Titan. It's the first 
time maybe for a span of a few months or quarters you've seen the SSG profile being slightly 
different between a Tanishq and a CaratLane. So just to understa nd, is it more, in your opinion, 
a perspective of the different customer segments and how they have been impacted or a lack of 
activations? Or are there any other aspect that you may want to read into looking at, say, the last 
nine months?  
Ajoy Chawla:  No, I think two things. As I said, in Tanishq, we cannot take the entire Tanishq performance, 
whether it's in -store or gross and compare it to CaratLane because the price points and segments 
are very different. Then there is a very large gold component als o sitting in Tanishq. So, actually, 
the studded -- and within Tanishq, the studded, less than INR  1 lakh and less than INR  50,000. 
And CaratLane is mostly below INR  50,000, the bulk of that. So I think they are not directly 
comparable from the  figures you have.  
 And I -- the second piece is CaratLane has added -- they've added lots of stores last year, so -- 
and many of them in the same towns as well. So there is likely to be some pluses and minuses 
happening there. In the case of Tanishq, the same -store growth u pside has been -- or better 
performance has been also driven by the gold part of the business in this quarter. So I'm not 
reading too much into this. I don't think -- and of course, the segments are different.  
 And picking up about which Venkat had shared in the last earnings call that when it comes to 
gold business, every -- it's a question of gaining share because the market is already penetrated. 
Customers are already buying gold jewellery. But when it comes to studded and that too in the 
sub INR 50,000, it is the case of market expansion. That segment is getting created as we go 
along.  
 And therefore, there is not much share to gain as much as getting more customers into this pipe. 
And that process doesn't happen overnight. So therefore, the behaviour of that segment versus 
the behaviour of the overall Jewellery segment will be different . So in that sense, yes, the 
customer segments are different and the opportunity spaces are different.  
Nihal Jham:  Got that. Could I just take one final question? Is that fine? I'll just go ahead that for the Watches 
& Wearables business, I think when we had the analyst meet two years back, we were looking 
at a target of 18% margin. Just wanted to check, are we on trac k and looking forward to that?  
Suparna Mitra:  Well, that looks like a very big dream ambition that we talked about INR  10,000 crores. And 
later, we had revised it down 16%  (margin) . INR10,000 crores would still be doubling the sales 
turnover in G UCP terms from INR  5,000 crores to INR  10,000 crores in a matter of three years.   Titan Company Limited

Page 10 of 20 
 
Sensitivity: Internal  So obviously, all of this requires a lot of investment s. And then we later kind of made it more 
realistic. So we are still pushing for maybe 15% -16% in the next -- after two years, yes.  
Moderator:  The next question is from Percy Panthaki from IIFL.  
Percy Panthaki:  I'll just start with one clarification. You have mentioned in your PPT that the India Jewellery 
growth is 21%. Would I be right in assuming that, that's a primary growth number?  
Ajoy Chawla:  Yes, yes. Our growth for the division, excluding CaratLane, just Tanishq, Mia , Zoya  is at 17% 
in secondary retail, Tanishq is 16%. And the primary growth would be around the 21% -22% 
mark. That's what we are seeing. And that's to do with the timing shift. In fact, we had a better 
secondary growth in the previous quarter, if you recollect. And the primary growth was lower at 
20%, so some shifts due to the season shifting.  
Percy Panthaki:  Okay, okay. So basically, the secondary sales growth is 17%.  
Ajoy Chawla:  17% for the division, 16% for Tanishq and CaratLane is separate . And that's for Y -T-D. To give 
you a better feel, look at Y -T-D. 
Percy Panthaki:  Sure. When you say 21%, does that include the CaratLane in it?  
Ajoy Chawla:  No, no, no, that is separately.  
Percy Panthaki:  Okay. Secondly, I just wanted to ask, and it's not a question pertaining to the quarter but more 
of trends that you've seen in last few quarters, do you think that, at an industry level, there is an 
accelerated shift from unorganized to organized, which is  happening? Anyway, see, there was, 
anyway, a shift happening since many years. But has this shift really materially accelerated? 
And if so, what are the drivers of that acceleration?  
 Because we are seeing not only you, but many of the other players, at least in the listed space, 
two or three other stocks, are also reporting fairly high growth numbers. So just from that point 
of view, I'm wondering if there is anything to read. So even  the World Gold Council data, which 
I see for demand -- of course, they don't include exchange jewellery and all that.  
 But for whatever it is worth, in Q2, that is a September quarter, they have actually, I think, shown 
a slight decline on a Y -o-Y basis in the jewellery demand, whereas I think all the organized 
players have done very well. So that is the context of the qu estion. So is there any such 
accelerated shift, first of all? And if so, what are the drivers? Is hallmarking a really big driver? 
And if so, I mean, just your thoughts on that?  
Ajoy Chawla:  No, I also think -- I don't have the hard data right now. But overall, if I see the growth and market 
share that we keep tracking for local players and then chains and our own brand, we have been 
seeing that as more and more chains are opening across diffe rent parts of the country, the growth 
rates are different. And therefore, yes, there is some kind of acceleration.  
And I think with people getting listed and having access to capital, there is greater expansion 
that is going on. And some of the other players are wanting to expand, put up stores and then 
probably go for IPO also. So there are both sets of players.  The other piece that I'm --   Titan Company Limited

Page 11 of 20 
 
Sensitivity: Internal  therefore, yes to what you are sensing, I also tend to resonate with that, notwithstanding the 
World Gold Council data because their figures are around kgs and grammage and all that stuff 
and it's too macro to conclude.  
The second piece is there's another phenomenon that exists that many local players are also 
becoming organized in the way they operate. They may be a one -off store or two or three stores, 
but they are changing the way they operate in response to the realit y that they are facing. And 
therefore, they are becoming sharper in terms of their customer service, their store ambience, 
the marketing that they're doing locally or even the kind of services they are offering and 
transparency with which they are also doi ng exchange and other things.  
So I think they've also understood that the name of the game is to become more organized and 
more transparent and therefore gain trust. So I think that's the other phenomenon that Tanishq  
sees. And therefore, I think this is secular and will continue to accelerate.  
Percy Panthaki:  Understood. Also just wanted to get some idea on a three -year horizon or a five -year horizon, 
what is the total number of Tanishq stores that you would be looking at, let's say, for FY28 or 
something like that?  
Ajoy Chawla:  To be honest, I don't have a number in mind. We are approaching this from a one -, two -year 
horizon because opportunities are emerging all the time. And to just give you a broad feel, we 
are present in 264 or 265 towns approximately. We think in existing to wns, as new catchments 
are emerging as well as newer towns, there is no reason why we -- in the next couple of years, 
why we can't reach out to 300 towns.  
But beyond that, can I have an answer? No. How many stores? No idea. So allow us some time, 
maybe whenever we have the Investor Day or when we are able to share with you a slightly 
longer horizon, we will do that. Right now, I don't have a number.  
Moderator:  The next question is from Aditya Soman from CLSA.  
Aditya Soman:  Sir, one question on the International Business. Can you give us a sense of -- I mean, you've 
given a number of 100% retail growth there. But can you just give us a more qualitative 
information on the average ticket size, especially in the US?  
Kuruvilla Markose:  Sorry, what is the first part of your question? I missed the first bit. Second bit is what I got.  
Aditya Soman:  Yes, yes. No, just in terms of qualitative information on ticket size and the customers that you 
are probably -- typical number of customers that you are looking for at the store level? And any 
sense on that would be super useful since we don't have contex t on those stores?  
Kuruvilla Markose:  Sure.  This is Diny  here from the IBD team. Ticket sizes across the board in almost all of our 
international locations are significantly higher than in India. We are ballpark in the two lakh 
(INR) customer kind of a space. And depending on the locations, particularly in the US, they are 
even higher than they are in GCC.    Titan Company Limited

Sensitivity: Internal   And even generally, the studded ratios are overall higher compared to what we find in India, 
which is -- which works for us because obviously the cost of operating in these markets are 
significantly higher, both, let's say, rental as well as people costs are significantly higher. And 
this allows or gives the business the ability to manage those costs much better. Sorry, yes, go 
on. 
Aditya Soman:  No, sorry, go on.  
Kuruvilla Markose:  So we see that holding out, in fact, as we go into -- over a period of time, we've seen that there 
is a certain stability that is happening there. And in certain cases, as we have a set of returning 
customers, we are even seeing some increases on that.  
Aditya Soman:  Understand. And can you just explain the economics? I mean, all these -- are these -- how many 
of these would be owned stores or franchise stores? And in terms of economics, are they similar 
from a margin perspective to what we are seeing in India or likel y to be similar to India in nature?  
Kuruvilla Markose:  Typically, wherever we're going first, we set up our own stores, company -owned, company -
operated L1 stores because it helps us understand the lay of the land and what we need to do in 
those markets and -- but we also, as we go along, bring in partners, eit her partners from India, 
existing partners. And many of them are eager.  
We have quite a few of our Indian partners reaching out to us saying that either they have a 
relative or they have some capability in an international city and they would like to set up a store.  
 So for example, in Dubai, the first four L2 partners are from the four regions of the country, 
from the North, from the East, South and the West. We have one interestingly from each of these 
regions in Dubai. So I mean, that overall, we still continue to hold that. We follow the same 
asset -light model that we are doing in India, where we will, over a period of time, look at having 
more L2 and L3 stores.  
But to get a sense of the business and to start operating, it always helps us when we do it as an 
L1 first. We're now starting to have L3 stores as well. For example, in Singapore, the store that 
we opened is with an L3 partner.  
Aditya Soman:  That's very clear. And one last question on the Indian ethnic wear business. There, you 
mentioned that growth has been a little slower. Any reason and any sort of information on why 
growth has been slower? And is this like across all the 3 months in the qu arter or it was again 
specific to December?  
Ambuj Narayan:  Yes, this is Ambuj here. When Venkat referred to the ethnic wear division, the growth thing 
though, he was referring more to the like -to-like, but where if you see our overall growth has 
been 61% in the last quarter. And quarter -on-quarter, we've been grow ing around that number. 
The YTD growth is about 70%. So he was referring more towards the like -to-like. And that's an 
industry -wide  phenomen a that we are seeing. 
 For the last 4 to 5 quarters, apparel industry has really seen very muted growth. A lot of brands, 
even they have shared that their like -to-likes have been negative. So we are doing well in the   Titan Company Limited

at ending this financial year with 75 stores.  
Moderator:  The next question from Rishi Mod i from Marcellus Investment Managers.  
Rishi Mod i: Sir, my first question is to Saumen. Saumen, you, last year, mentioned that this year is going to 
be a more consolidation phase for the eyewear segment. And we've seen not added a lot of stores 
this year. So if you could just give us some qualitative under standing of what are you doing 
behind the scenes to get this to be on a sustainable business?  
What are the low -hanging fruits, where you can cut costs? Where are you seeing the growth? 
How are you going to go for these initiatives? If you could just give some qualitative feedback 
on this? 
Saumen Bhaumik:  Yes. Like you said, this year, we begin with the view that we need to sort of make those 300 -
odd stores that we opened in the previous 24 months because we were in a rapid expansion spree. 
I also did say 2 years back that we'll reach a number of 1,000 stor es in the network. But we 
realized that as much as it is important to expand footprint, but we also have to make sure that 
every such investment yields the required return, both for us, wherever we are investing, or for 
our partners. So tha t's been the focus mostly was to make sure that the network starts delivering.  
 And so that said, we are not -- we did not mean that we will not expand at all. We actually added 
about 65 stores but pretty much 40, 50 stores, also you have to sort of deal with because of the 
wrong location or various other things. So overall, network count has not significantly changed.  
And probably some time in the early part of the next year, we begin the expansion. But typically 
again, we'll be looking at a catchment and need to be more concentrated around the top 25 cities 
rather than going wide and deep. That is as far as the network  or the footprint is concerned.  
 As far as overall business is concerned, I think that we had a relatively higher growth target for 
the year. I think 22% -23% is what we began the year with. And first 2 quarters, we had 12% and 
16%, respectively in terms of growth. And Quarter 3, as I explained that we faced unanticipated 
headwind, and as I explained, it also seems like an industry -level phenomenon.  
 And so we did not see growth in this quarter and which reflected definitely on the bottom line. 
Because the rest of the things, we are okay. But top line directly cascaded down to the bottom 
line. So we would believe that it is not a long -term phenomenon.  It is probably a 3 -4 months  
window and it would change. And yes, so therefore, our overall ambitions for the category 
remains strong and positive.  
Rishi Mod i: So Saumen, just to clarify, right, if I understand our front end has some issues or some stores are 
in the wrong locations? Apart from that, there are no issues in our inventory, supply chain, 
manufacturing, those are all sorted out according to you?  
Saumen Bhaumik:  Absolutely.

Rishi Mod i: Okay, fine. All right. My next question is to Suparna. Suparna, if you could just give us an 
understanding of, firstly, how are you seeing the Wearables to grow now that it's crossed INR100 
crores top line? How much potential is there? And what's the propo sitioning that we are offering 
versus the more integrated players and as well on the analog watches  growth ? 
Suparna Mitra:  Yes. So Wearables, we closed last year with more than INR  500 crores turnover at consumer 
price level. And this year, we have seen phenomenal growth of Fastrack smartwatches. And this 
has been both on our own on -ground channels as well as in marketplace e -commerce. And we 
have actually from Quarter 1 to now gained market share. We used to be about 5% -6%. Now we 
are at 8%, 9%. So we have gained ground. This is on the back of very well -timed good product 
quality. In fact, our market returns are  among the lowest, very well styled products in the 
INR1,500 to INR3,500 to INR4,000 range.  
 And we also had a very big campaign with -- in Quarter 2, which kind of gave us a lot of visibility 
on Fastrack smartwatches. Going ahead, the game will be played both from Fastrack 
smartwatches, which will be in that ballpark close to INR  2,000 -3,000 price range, as well as the 
Titan smartwatches, which will be roughly in the INR  8,000 to INR  15,000 price range.  And 
there will be more differentiated products with a lot of technology built -in, which will be under 
the branding Titan. And this will actually get sold more either in mobile stores or in our Titan 
World stores.  This is for a smaller, more niche group of customers that some people who are 
really looking for more features and a better app experience, etcetera. So overall, we see that 
base business will almost double in the next -- like continue to grow 80% -- around 70% to 80%  
every year. And this strategic plan leverages our strength of brands, of channels, of technology.  
We have our own Titan Smart Labs in Hyderabad with more than 80 engineers who are working 
on a lot of differentiated products as well as apps. And so that's really the plan for Wearables. 
For analog watches, the growth has been -- continues to be quite goo d. And this is across 
channels. We have our own EBO s last year doing quite well in large -format stores as well as 
marketplace e -com.  
Premiumization is the big game there. And we are doing very well in brand Titan as well as 
international brands, which are in the higher price points. Quarter 3 was an important quarter, 
where we broke new ground with the launch of two brands, Vyb from Fas track, which is of 
young women fast fashion kind of watch sub -brand, and Poze from Sonata, which is the more 
mass brand, which is for both men and women.  
 And these are offering very good styling and reasonably good quality at very attractive prices. 
So this has opened up a lot of -- has helped us acquire a lot of new customers at a more affordable 
reach. So it is, in a way -- again, it's the twin strategy,  acquiring new customers, both fashion -
oriented at the lower end and continue to get -- to ride the premiumization wave with high 
margins and highly desired brands like Titan at the top . 
Rishi Mod i: Okay, so premiumization is working well for us. So we've got to feel good there. Wearables, are 
we profitable if we look at it as a stand -alone business?    Titan Company Limited

Rishi Mody:  What are the  margin profiles Analog v/s Wearables?  
Suparna Mitra:  So we have not really fussed about profitability. We can make a profit. We are breakeven. But 
we do want to invest. So these are very considered calls to continuing to invest, there is no hurry 
for us to break even or to make a huge profit. But the fundamental profile of the business is -- 
gives us enough room for profitability.  
Rishi Mod i: Okay. So the unit economics, please  
C K Venkataraman:  Could you repeat that? Your voice is cracking.  
Rishi Mod i: The unit economics for profit is there for Wearables. You're already upfronting the investment 
maybe through marketing or investments. That's not giving the profitability -- okay, fine. All 
right. That's it from my end.  
Moderator:  Next question is from the line of Dhairya from ABG.  
Dhairya:  Actually, my question was more related to primary sales made to L3 franchise es. So this was a 
follow -up question maybe on the UCP. So I just wanted to understand if you can shed some light 
on how new stores perform in terms of sales made to them, the total primary sales and how are 
the turnover and inventory for the firs t year. 
Ajoy Chawla:  So when we say primary, actually, it's not so much new stores. There will be a few new stores, 
but a bulk of that is to existing L3 partners to stock up or stock down based on the season. So in 
this quarter, because it was a festive quarter and the festive  season was late, the primary effect 
that usually happens in Q2 didn't happen and happened in this quarter. And whatever they have 
upstocked, it's as per their norms. It's not something that they have stocked up and they're going 
to return bac k. 
 For new stores, new stores are stock ed as per the norms based on the absolute turnover we expect 
to see in year one. And the minimum threshold is put there. So most of the primary versus 
secondary difference in growth that we are seeing has nothing much to do with new stores as 
much as to do w ith existing L3 partners either having stock ed now increases because of their 
business has grown itself.  
Dhairya:  Okay, understood. Just one clarification. You said that for the new stores, it is basically the sales 
which you are expecting plus some additional stock they are keeping?  
Ajoy Chawla:  Threshold . No, see, you need to have certain mix of products in any store, whether it is daily 
wear, whether it is occasion, light occasion, chain, fingerings earrings, blah blah, all of that. So 
there is a certain assortment mix which is needed for a store, below which it doesn't make sense 
to put up a store at all.    Titan Company Limited

Page 16 of 20 
 
Sensitivity: Internal   And thereafter, if the top line is likely to be much higher, we might actually increase it beyond 
the threshold. That's what I meant. It's not sales plus something additional. It is an absolute 
assortment, which can be flexed upwards, depending on the pro jections of that particular store. 
It depends on the catchment.  
Moderator:  The next question is from the line of Sheela Rathi from Morgan Stanley.  
Sheela Rathi:  Just extending to the previous participant's question, as we're opening more L2, L3 stores right 
now, is it fair to believe that the payback period, including the working capital, would have 
improved in a positive manner in the recent years and if you coul d remind us what that would 
be? 
Ajoy Chawla:  Payback period for an L2 or L3 franchise, yes, it's pretty good. And typically, within 2 years -- 
not payback. Let's say, they would start making EBIT positive within 2 years. And within 3 
years, they would, I would think, have a payback. L3, maybe slightl y different because they 
don't look at payback from an inventory point of view.  
They look at it more from the investment that goes into interiors and property and so on and so 
forth. But it's pretty attractive. And it continues to remain attractive because overall, the size of 
the business per store has gone up.  
Sheela Rathi:  Understood. And Ajoy, again, a second question on the Jewellery business only. Just to get a 
better perspective on the demand conditions right now, especially you said that January seems 
to be better than where we were in December. Now when we look at the gold prices, they have 
not really come down. They are at the same levels broadly versus where they were -- where they 
ended in December.  
 So is it fair to say that -- I mean, is it one of these three that either the customer has accepted this 
high gold price and is coming back to the stores or the customers are very excited about the 
upcoming wedding season and they're coming back to the st ore? 
Or is it that we are making necessary investments like we did in the previous quarters in terms 
of getting the customer back to the stores and it is much higher than where we were earlier?  
Ajoy Chawla:  So to be honest, I also can't give you a firm answer. But I think the first point that you raised is 
the more likely, where customers start accepting that this is a new price of gold. And in general, 
I think December, a lot of travel, a lot of share of wal let expenses going here and there is also a 
hard reality.  
So for whatever it's worth, Jan is certainly not at all like December and thankfully so. I wouldn't 
give too much weight to because it's difficult to gauge. I don't see anything significantly driven 
by wedding or whatever. That will happen as it keeps happ ening.

   Titan Company Limited

Page 17 of 20 
 
Sensitivity: Internal   
Tejash Shah:  My first question is for Ajoy. Ajoy, you mentioned that you step up investments tactically 
sometimes to respond to competitive pressure. So what is the nature of this response? Is it more 
discounts or ad spends or something else?  
Ajoy Chawla:  So usually, it will be a combination of both. Offers could be there, exchange can be another one, 
a gold price protection plan if there's a lot of volatility. And we hear also some customers staying 
away. We try, some of them may work, may not. Marketing, yes, that's also another piece which 
we do.  
 But marketing typically would be around this particular offers or promotions that we run, 
whether exchange or gold price. And marketing is also somewhat strategic. Let's say we see that 
wedding needs to continuously be on as in always on, so we are continuing to invest. And we -
- even if the season is up or down, we may say no, let’s sustain it. Because suddenly, you might 
find that a rush of people coming in. But it's a mix of all these three.  
Tejash Shah:  Second question the results that we have seen from companies that have been reported for the 
quarter in lifestyle retail so far. We have witnessed a very sharp demand deceleration from many 
categories. And some companies have called out or attributed this to very high base just created 
last year because of COVID bump -up. So are we seeing any signs based on our numbers? And 
how are we reading consumer sentiment for the near to medium term?  
C K Venkataraman : Firstly, the income classes where different industries and different companies particularly 
operate would have a great bearing on the question that you're asking. So we're seeing a lot of 
slowdown or sluggishness in staples, in motorcycles, whereas cars, p articularly the SUVs and 
above , were doing exceedingly well. Titan Company's broad customer base is in the top part of 
the income pyramid. And that has generally played out well for us over the last many years.  
 And the substantial share of jewelry business in our portfolio and jewelry is not an indulgence 
product, it is a store of value also and in a category where the market share is low and the 
acceleration of formalization is also happening. So in a way, the performance of Titan Company 
over the last many quarters has been better than some of the examples that you're citing. And in 
a way, it is continuing. If I look at some of the results which has come up in the last couple of 
weeks, it continues to reinforce  that. 
 And our own performance in Jewellery in Q3, while it was slightly lower than Q2, it was actually 
overall strong if you look at the portfolio of Jewellery. Our performance -- sales growth 
performance in Watches was also very strong. It's in EyeCare. It's i n same -store growth of 
Taneira. It's in the perfumes business. International has been very strong. It's in EyeCare and the 
other two that we've had some challenges. And these need to be seen -- finally, a quarter is just 
3 months.  
 So from a lifestyle of a brand, and I'm not here talking about a long li fe-time -- from a 2 -3-year 
time frame, a quarter is still only a quarter. And our overall confidence is very high. And it's a 
combination of three factors. One is the prediction on the growth in these top income class 
segments over the next few years, when we move from INR  2,200 to IN  R5,000 per capita GDP,   Titan Company Limited
  February  01, 202 4  
Page 18 of 20 
 
Sensitivity: Internal  it's actually a very high growth rate of these top two income segments, in fact, even the third 
income segment. And therefore, you're going to get a tailwind from that.  
 The second is in most of the categories in which we operate, our market share is still single 
digits. And combined with the acceleration in formalizing, that's another tailwind that we are 
seeing. And the third is that our natural behavior and strength in  terms of going deep into Bharat 
with all our brands is accelerating, some of the town names I mentioned.  
 So considering all these three things, our overall outlook for medium term, which is FY '25, FY 
'26, continues to be very strong. We need to become better in managing our operations and 
extract more value from the scale that we are actually generating. Th at is going to be the focus 
certainly for the company and all divisions for FY '25.  
Moderator:  The next question is from the line of Manoj Menon from ICICI Securities.  
Manoj Menon:  A few couple of ones. One, on the gold price premium, the commodity premium, where is it 
currently? And do you still think there is significant corrections you need to make over the next 
12, 24 months in the context of accelerated formalization and existing brands also expanding, 
etcetera? The reason I'm asking because even in a very competitive market like in Chennai, as I 
understand, I think we've seen there is a 1% premium which you still managed to hold on to.  
Ajoy Chawla:  Yes, so we still do that. We have a premium across markets and it varies in different markets. 
We think we can continue to hold on to that premium because that small percentages, whatever 
they are, Chennai notwithstanding, I think the customer is willing t o give that premium for 
Tanishq and the reliability as well as our exchange program and so many other transparent, 
trustworthy practices that we follow.  
 So we think we can continue to hold. Of course, if the rest of the market goes down further, then 
we will have to respond. But I'm not seeing so much of that happening unless and until there is 
some increased amount of smuggling and other such things that  come into the market, which I 
can't really say. So as of now, we think we can continue to hold on to the small premiums that 
we are continuing right now.  
Manoj Menon:  Okay, very clear. Is this hypothesis, will it hold good even in a scenario of, let's say, full -fledged 
actual implementation of hallmarking on the ground, including inspection efforts?  
Ajoy Chawla:  Yes, I don't think that hallmark -- actually, hallmarking has not driven this. I don't believe 
hallmarking is the one which has created this. It is just price warrior approach by different 
players. Hallmarking is not the driver.  
Manoj Menon:  Secondly, when we look at the medium term now with 100% ownership for CaratLane, how do 
you look at both the brands, CaratLane and Mia? Do you really think you need both of them 
targeting different consumer, let's say, requirements? Or sometime in the medi um term, is it -- 
you haven't thought about it saying that, "Look, it is better to focus on actually one"?  
Ajoy Chawla:  Actually, I have maintained this earlier also. These are two horses in a multiple horse play. There 
are many, many players in this. And this segment is growing. And both these brands are not only   Titan Company Limited
  February  01, 202 4  
Page 19 of 20 
 
Sensitivity: Internal  growing but are also very profitable. So actually, it helps us. In fact, even Tanishq plays pretty 
much in the everyday space significantly in diamonds.  So if you ask me, there is Tanishq, there 
is Mia, there is CaratLane. And as more players come in, given catchment in a given market, if 
we are the dominant player there in a segment which is evolving it is great.  
 Thirdly, the typographic profile for each of these customer segments is very different. Even 
product language is different between Mia and, let's say, CaratLane. Mia also has a lot more of 
14 carats. CaratLane has a different kind of profile. So I think i f you -- and if you visit each of 
each of our formats and look at each of the product mix, you will find that there are some 
overlaps.  But there are also some certain areas which each brand is very, very strong. So I think 
as long as the brands are profita ble and continue to grow, which we are seeing very good growth 
and good brand profitability, we don't see any reason to consolidate or try to -- and anyway, 
there are separate teams running each of these.  
Manoj Menon:  Got it, clear. Just quickly between Mia and CaratLane, what would be broadly the, let's say, the 
proportion of consumers who would have shopped at both or the lower list is what I'm trying to 
get at? Is it a significantly higher number? Or is it largely dr iven by both brands are growing by, 
let's say, outside of -- or let's say getting newer consumers into your group?  
Ajoy Chawla:  So I would instinctively feel that we are getting new consumers and overlaps are not so much. 
But I don't have data to kind of -- between Mia and Tanishq, there will be overlap because Mia 
is a sub -brand of Tanishq and it's also available in the Tanishq st ore, so a lot of gifting, older 
customer buying for a younger person, etcetera. But I think CaratLane and Mia probably will 
not have too much overlap. But I'm just giving you a very top of the mind answer.  
Manoj Menon:  And one quick one, if I may. When I think about the next 12, 24 months, is it fair to assume that 
nearly 100% of your incremental expansion in Jewellery will happen through L3? And given the 
state of balance sheet currently, which is still very strong but with debt, etcetera, is it fair to 
assume that you will actually dial up the L3 route, let's say, in the last couple of years?  
Ajoy Chawla:  Not really. We are actually pursuing more L2s. L3s are for certain markets. It's all remote and 
so on. In fact, L2 makes more profitable sense for the company is what our understanding is. 
Capital efficiency could vary. But I don't think -- I mean, Ashok, maybe if you want to add 
anything.  
Ashok Sonthalia:  Nothing significant  shift we expect at this point of time. I think the same ratio is likely to 
continue.  
Moderator:  We take the last question from the line of Kunal Vora from BNP Paribas.  
Kunal Vora:  Sir, earlier question, you indicated confidence about growth in FY '25 and '26. So is it fair to say 
that you're confident of delivering the 20% CAGR in Jewellery, which you aspire to deliver?

kind of -- yes, of course, we -- yes, we continue to see positive signs  there. And we will continue.

horizon, we had actually exceeded it. And despite that, we are continuing to grow at this CAGR 
equivalent rate.  
Kunal Vora:  Yes, but you don't see any headwinds. I mean, we are seeing headwinds in some other categories. 
Maybe the category has slowed down. But like for Jewellery and for yourself, you think the 
growth rate should continue?  
Ashok Sonthalia:  Our FY '27 guidance, which we presented in our Investor Day remains the same. There is -- and 
we are not at all worried about that. Actually, the first 2 years of that 5 -year horizon has turned 
out very well. We are -- we believe we are comfortably placed to kind of eventually achieve -- 
while it is a  bit stretch ed, but we will achieve that.  
C K Venkataraman : And you need to really deeply consider the sector dynamics, the competitive position of each of 
our brands, and in this case, the jewellery brands in the sector, the customer profiles that we are 
targeting versus some other sectors, the very low market sha re that we have compared to other 
companies in other sectors, total value aspect of this category as opposed to something which is 
seen as expenditure, so many things.  
 And the status aspect of diamond jewellery as India becomes more affluent. There's so many 
factors which are in our favor, and that's why our confidence as against maybe some other sectors 
and some other companies.  
Kunal Vora:  Sure, that's very clear. Second and last one is now that you own almost 100% of CaratLane, does 
anything change in the way you're managing it? And also, will it remain a subsidiary? Or would 
we look to merge it with the parent company?  
C K Venkataraman:  Actually, nothing has changed. Everything remains the same. It's a separate brand. It's a separate 
organization. It's a separate leadership team, which is governed by a Board, which continues to 
be the same Board for a while now. And there is no plan to merge it  into Titan.  
Ajoy Chawla:  And just to add, there is enough cross -learning and sharing of whatever help is needed from 
either side. And that continues as is, in fact, it can only improve.  
Moderator:  We'll take that as the last question. I would now like to hand the conference back to Mr. C.K. 
Venkataraman for closing comments.  
C K Venkataraman:  Thank you very much, everyone. It was a wonderful conversation and see you soon.  
Moderator:  Thank you very much. On behalf of the Titan Company Limited, that concludes this conference. 
Thank you for joining us, ladies and gentlemen. You may now disconnect your lines.
