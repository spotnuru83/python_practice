Sensitivity: Internal  so many, we went ahead and expanded because we found the right opportunity, right property, 
and we were able to get those going before Dhan teras. 
 And we have now, in a way, expanded the list of towns and markets and said whenever the 
opportunity presents itself, we will go ahead and open because execution can follow thereafter. 
In the case of CaratLane, while 40 have been opened, there were, I think , 90 opened last year. 
So many of those 90 had to stabilize as well. And there are many more which will come into 
play as we go forward. So this is not indicative of any long -term strategy. This has something to 
do within this year, that's all.  
C K Venkataraman:  Plus one thing to keep in mind, Latika, is this is not the equivalent of an expensive car versus a 
more affordable car, which can go to smaller towns faster than an expensive car. Tanishq is a 
more traditional jewellery  brand, which is available in a Rivaah, in Sagar, in places like that, 
where generally people buy jewellery . Whereas at CaratLane, it will take longer time to reach a 
Rivaah or a Sagar. So that's advantage that Tanishq has. So that also has a bearing in this plus 
what Ajoy s aid about 90 plus 40 here.  
Ajoy Chawla:  So if I may carry on, Mia and CaratLane actually will continue to see more opportunities also. 
It's just a timing piece. I mean, last year, 90 and, therefore, this year, whether 40 will become 
50, 70, 80, 90, that depends on the opportunities. And therefor e, you must see it over a 2 -year 
time frame rather than a single year.  
Latika Chopra:  Sure. That helps. The second bit I wanted to ask was your other two segments. On Watches, how 
-- you talked about higher marketing expense impacting margins. But on a full year basis or over 
medium term, how should we think about the margin profile, given the salience of Wearables 
will keep rising?  
 And on eyewear separately, numbers on like -to-like growth rates have been muted. And it seems 
store addition has slowdown this fiscal year. So are there any aspects you intend to revisit here 
to drive better growth momentum in this segment? Thank you.  
Suparna Mitra:  So for Watches, yes, in the festive season, we spent a lot of money marketing our brands and all 
our festive collection. So that is kind of way higher than what we had spent last year. And it did 
help us in getting a very good sales top line growth. The overall margin, which we had earlier 
indicated maybe 13 right now, 11 to 12, at least for the next couple of quarters.  
Because of the overall mix, as you mentioned, Wearables, where the AGC (adjusted gross 
contribution) is slightly lower, becoming a big propeller of growth. And so therefore, it is -- at 
this point, this is -- it will kind of see this kind of margin for the next two / couple of quarters.  
Saumen Bhaumik:  Latika, this is Saumen from EyeCare. Beginning of the year, I think we have said that our 
expansion will be calibrated. So it is not a rapid expansion. That said, in the year, I think we're 
almost over 60 -plus stores. But we also had to rationalize a few stores, which are not sort of 
delivering the expected kind of numbers. So net count has not significantly changed. But 
expansion and rationalization both happen ed simultaneously.
