about 80 basis points this quarter. In my opinion, a 2% mix change towards studded should have 
have seen gold prices go up 16% year -on-year. And that's the season where everybody is waiting 
Devanshu Bansal:  Yes. So I was thinking that 20% -- yes, sure.  
Ajoy Chawla:  So our EBIT margins continue to be in the range that was indicated between 12% to 13%, despite 
this weak studded quarter and weaker than what, let's say, we had last year. So at 12.2%, it is 
good. It is exactly bang on in that range of 12.4%.  
 So to me and to Ashok and all of us, we've been saying 12% to 13% is a very good range to 
of the 12% to 13% range.  
much close to the budget that we have had in the beginning of the year , we had 12% and 16% 
at a target of 18% margin. Just wanted to check, are we on trac k and looking forward to that?  
later, we had revised it down 16%  (margin) . INR10,000 crores would still be doubling the sales 
realistic. So we are still pushing for maybe 15% -16% in the next -- after two years, yes.  
growth is 21%. Would I be right in assuming that, that's a primary growth number?  
Ajoy Chawla:  Yes, yes. Our growth for the division, excluding CaratLane, just Tanishq, Mia , Zoya  is at 17% 
in secondary retail, Tanishq is 16%. And the primary growth would be around the 21% -22% 
20%, so some shifts due to the season shifting.  
Percy Panthaki:  Okay, okay. So basically, the secondary sales growth is 17%.  
Ajoy Chawla:  17% for the division, 16% for Tanishq and CaratLane is separate . And that's for Y -T-D. To give 
Percy Panthaki:  Sure. When you say 21%, does that include the CaratLane in it?  
given a number of 100% retail growth there. But can you just give us a more qualitative 
been 61% in the last quarter. And quarter -on-quarter, we've been grow ing around that number. 
The YTD growth is about 70%. So he was referring more towards the like -to-like. And that's an 
the year. I think 22% -23% is what we began the year with. And first 2 quarters, we had 12% and 
16%, respectively in terms of growth. And Quarter 3, as I explained that we faced unanticipated 
have actually from Quarter 1 to now gained market share. We used to be about 5% -6%. Now we 
are at 8%, 9%. So we have gained ground. This is on the back of very well -timed good product 
base business will almost double in the next -- like continue to grow 80% -- around 70% to 80%  
understand, I think we've seen there is a 1% premium which you still managed to hold on to.  
Manoj Menon:  Secondly, when we look at the medium term now with 100% ownership for CaratLane, how do 
nearly 100% of your incremental expansion in Jewellery will happen through L3? And given the 
that you're confident of delivering the 20% CAGR in Jewellery, which you aspire to deliver?  
Kunal Vora:  Sure, that's very clear. Second and last one is now that you own almost 100% of CaratLane, does
